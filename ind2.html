        <h1 class="h-primary">The different types of space stress</h1>
        <p>Stress is a response of the body as it adapts to hostile environments. 
        This broad definition includes stress from speaking in front of an audience, stress
         from a wound or stress from living in weightlessness in a fragile spacecraft far from home </p>
        <p>Let us discuss the 2 major stresses </p>

                <p class="center">Microgravity is the condition in which people or objects appear to be weightless.
                 The effects of microgravity can be seen when astronauts and objects float in space. Microgravity
                  can be experienced in other ways, as well. "Micro-" means "very small," so microgravity refers to 
                  the condition where gravity seems to be very small. In microgravity, astronauts can float in their spacecraft - or outside, on a spacewalk. Heavy objects move around easily. For example, astronauts can move equipment
                   weighing hundreds of pounds with their fingertips. Microgravity is sometimes called "zero gravity," but this is misleading.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Cosmic radiation</h2>
                <p class="center">Radiation from space is called cosmic radiation, which is constantly hitting the Earth. Our solar system’s Sun and other stars in the galaxy emit a constant stream of cosmic radiation
                The Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic shield protect us from cosmic radiation. Earth’s magnetic shield protects us from the cosmic radiation and is strongest at the equator and weakest near the poles. The magnetic shield diverts most of the radiation around the earth. Earth’s atmosphere shields us from most of the remaining radiation that travels to Earth. Part of our exposure to cosmic radiation depends on the elevation where we live.</p>
