        <p>A lot of  creature respond to stress differently from each other .Living organisms cope with stressful conditions by any of the following methods<br>
        Method # 1. Regulate
        Method # 2. Conform
        Method # 3. Migrate
        Method # 4. Suspend</p>
        <p>Let us discuss the 2 major stresses </p>

                <p class="center">The very first cockroach to be sent to space is nadezhda.during the mission it had succesfully
                created 33 offspprings. Since then Cockroacheshave been widely tested on. The major factors for its survival
                is its exoskeleton structure.<br><br>
                STRESS CONDITION:Can withstand high pressures(upto 900 times its own weight) and can craw at upto 2mm. </p>

                <p class="center">Tardigrades are said to be the most resilient creatures of all time. it can survive in vaccum and very 
                hostile conditions.It can also survive in very high barometric pressure and very high cosmic radiation.
                Scientists have also found that they can survive in ver dry conditions due to a protien known as intrinsically disordered protien
                <br><br> STRESS CONDITION: Can survive in vaccum and extremely dry weather.</p>
